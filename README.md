# -Employee_DabeBase_challenge
##Purpose of this analysis:
The purpose of this was to create a new assignment from two technical analysis and summarize his finding in the report. The first section will consist of the the number of retiring employees by their title, next will be the elible employess from the mentorship program and lastly an overall analyisis of the employee database wihch will provide Bobby's mangager the current employees reaching retirement for the "silver tsunami".

Bobby's manager assigned several assigmenets to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who may be eligible for the mentorship program.
 Bobby used SQL queries to design a retirement table, which was created from the employee database of the most recent title employees. He created statments in his query that would provide the number of current employees retirement aged employees by most recent job title excluding those who were no longer with the company. As we can determine the from the SQL query from the Pewlett-Hackard-Anaylsis, the employee datebase of employees retirment titles baed on the current employees. Bobby was able to query to determine retitement table of employees who were born between January 1,1952 and December 31,1955 to filiter in the Retitement Titles table.

 Bobby was able to extract data to exclude employees who left, to create the number of employees who were just retiring so that the managers will be able to determine how many employees are reaching retirement for the "silver tsunami". The company needed to have the total number of Senior engineers retiring which were 25,916 employees which were going to be replaced once they retired. Along with Senior staffing of 24,926 employees and 9,285 engineers, 7,636 staff members, 3,603 Technique Leaders and 1,090 Assitant Engineer, as well as 2 Managers all of which are retiring within the company.

Finally Bobby wrote a query to create a table that held the employeses who were eligible to participate in the mentorship program.  The was able to use SQL to query the employee number, first and last name their date of birth and from and to date of employment with thier title.

  In SUMMARY:
  In summary, all four of the resource table provided an overview to understand how many employees are retiring in each title by employees number and name to provided them with the mentorship eligibity along with providing human resources with the number of positions that will require to be refilled acccording to each of the employees retirement date. This data also provides human resources with the overall titles that were held by each employee that may effect the overall job recruitment if one employee held more that one title. Some of the employes held multiple roles over the during of thier employment with the company which effects if they were to split the roles of one employee to two new hires. It will effect the budget for salary depedending on the number of years that they will now require for each title being replaced. This may overall effect may make an impact to replace current employees reaching retirement for the "silver tsunami". At the same token the number of retirees being replaced may create a restucturing form within and new methodogies by the new hires to create innovate ways to build within the company.
